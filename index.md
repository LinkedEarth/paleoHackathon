## Virtual Workshop Date: February 18th and 19th, 2021, 9am-4pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8)

This hackathon focuses on Python tools for the analysis of paleoclimate data. By the end of the hackathon, participants will be able to:
* Understand the basics of paleo data structures
* Manipulate these structures
* Understand age model ensembles
* Process paleo timeseries (e.g., binning, interpolation, detrending)
* Apply spectral and wavelet analysis, with appropriate uncertainty quantification
* Correlate a paleo timeseries to a climate field
* Correlate two time-uncertain timeseries
* Compare a record to climate simulations and reanalysis datasets
* Generate publication-quality graphics
* Manage complex workflows
