## Virtual Workshop Date: March 9-11, 2022, 9am-4pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8)
PaleoHack aims to bring the power of the Python software ecosystem to all paleoclimatologists. PaleoHack builds on the work of the [LinkedEarth](http://linked.earth) project, funded by the US National Science Foundation [EarthCube](http://earthcube.org) program (ICER-1541029). In particular, it makes use of the [Linked Paleo Data standard](https://lipd.net) and the [Pyleoclim package](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  

This hackathon (the third of its kind) is supported by NSF grant AGS 2002556 from the [P2C2 program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5750) and is **geared towards Python beginners** wanting to develop skills in analyzing paleoclimate data with Python. The workshop, which serves as a stepping stone for more advanced Pyleoclim trainings, will introduce students to the scientific Python ecosystem, including:
* the scientific Python "[stack](https://barbagroup.github.io/essential_skills_RRC/jupyter/1/)", mainly NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)

The hackathon will feature a mix of introductory lectures (on Zoom), Jupyter-based practicums, and live Slack conversations. Practicums will be conducted in the cloud, alleviating software requirements (see FAQ for details).

By the end of the hackathon, participants will be able to:
* Master the basics of Python coding (flow control, common data structures).
* Write reproducible computational narratives within a Jupyter environment.
* Understand the basics of paleo data structures
* Manipulate these structures
* Understand and visualize age model ensembles
* Process and visualize paleoclimate timeseries (e.g., binning, interpolation, detrending)

## Overview Schedule

The hackathon will take place on Zoom. A tentative schedule is available [here](https://linkedearth.github.io/paleoHackathon/schedule).

## Participating

* The hackathon will be a combination of livestreams, live discussions, and Slack conversations.
* The hackathon is organized around practicum sessions designed to get you started with the [Pyleoclim package](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
* See our [FAQ](https://linkedearth.github.io/paleoHackathon/faq) for requirements.
* Register [here](https://forms.gle/R6sLLSLc1W8cbPY16) by **Feb 11th, 2022**. We are aware that Python is a popular language and that many people want to learn it. We regret to say that we cannot train everyone on the planet. To fit within our funding mandate, your application needs to make clear that 1) you work in the paleosciences and 2) you intend to use Python/Pyleoclim for your research. 

## Support

The hackathon is free to attend and is supported by the National Science Foundation grant 2002556 (P2C2 program).
