title: PaleoHack 4, Bring Your Own Project
---
---

## June 20-23, 2023, Marina Del Rey, CA
The geosciences are entering an exciting phase, with open-source research ecosystems opening new avenues of investigation. PaleoHack aims to bring the power of the Python software ecosystem to all paleoclimatologists. PaleoHack builds on the work of the [LinkedEarth](http://linked.earth) and [PaleoCube](https://medium.com/cyberpaleo/announcing-the-next-linkedearth-chapter-paleocube-790778b6ffb0) projects, funded by the US National Science Foundation [EarthCube](http://earthcube.org) program. In particular, it makes use of the [Linked Paleo Data standard](https://lipd.net) and the [Pyleoclim package](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/).  This workshop aims to introduce 10-15 early-career researchers to cloud-based paleoclimatology, including:
- advanced timeseries analysis
- analysis of paleoclimate data syntheses
- confrontations of paleo observations and model output
- interfaces with other paleosciences (e.g. paleoecology, paleoceanography, archeology)

This hackathon will be supported by NSF grant AGS 2002556 from the [P2C2 program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5750) and is **geared towards researchers with prior Python experience** wanting to bring their research to the next level.

## Format
This is a "Bring Your Own Project" event: participants are expected to bring a science proposal and have done the preliminary work of assembling data and code resources to make it happen. The [facilitators](https://linkedearth.github.io/paleoHackathon/organizers), as well as your hard work and collaborations, will turn these plans into a reality.
 The workshop will feature a mix of demos, team-building activities, solo and group coding time, to accelerate your research progress towards a particular science goal (ideally, one or more publications). A particular interest of ours is to foster collaboration between paleoclimate modelers and observationalists, using the LiPD ecosystem and the [LinkedEarth Research Hub](http://linked.earth/research_hub.html).
