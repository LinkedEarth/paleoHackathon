    "# Correlation Analysis: Prelude to Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation analysis, despite its simplicity and many shortcomings, remains a centerpiece of empirical analysis in many fields, particularly the paleosciences. Computing correlations is trivial enough; the difficulty lies in properly assessing their significance. Of particular importance are three considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Persistence, which violates the standard assumption that the data are independent (which underlies the classical test of significance implemented, e.g. in Excel).\n",
    "- Time irregularities, for instance comparing two records with different time axes, possibly unevenly spaced (which standard software cannot deal with out of the box)\n",
    "- Age uncertainties for example comparing two records, each with an ensemble of plausible chronologies (generated, for instance, by a Bayesian age model)\n",
    "- Test multiplicity aka the \"Look Elsewhere effect\", which states that repeatedly performing the same test can result in unacceptably high type I error (accepting correlations as significant, when in fact they are not). This arises e.g. when correlating a paleoclimate record with an instrumental field, assessing significance at thounsands of grid points at once, or assessing significance within an age ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly,  Pyleoclim facilitates an assessment of correlations that deals with all these cases, makes the necessary data transformations transparent to the user, and allows for one-line plot commands to visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we reproduce the case of [Hu et al, 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2016.11.048), particularly the example of their section 4, which illustrates several of these pitfalls at once.  "
