    "## Preamble\n",
    "Analyzing the frequency content of time series is a critical task in many of the paleosciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate how to use the spectral analysis features of Pyleoclim using the \"ODP846\" record described in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mix, A. C., J. Le, and N. J. Shackleton (1995a), Benthic foraminiferal stable isotope stratigraphy from Site 846: 0–1.8 Ma, Proc. Ocean Drill. Program Sci. Results, 138, 839–847.\n",
    "- Shackleton, N. J. (1995), New data on the evolution of Pliocene climate variability, in Paleoclimate and Evolution, With Emphasis on Human Origins, edited by E. S. Vrba et al., pp. 242-248, Yale Univ. Press, New Haven, CT.\n",

    "The record was aligned to the Benthic Stack of [Lisiecki & Raymo (2005)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004PA001071) using the [HMM-Match](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014PA002713) algorithm [(Lin et al, 2017)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016PA003057).  The latter is a probabilistic method that generates an ensemble of 1000 possible age models compatible with the chronostratigraphic constraints.\n",

    "After invoking some useful packages, we first load the LiPD file containing the data. The file contains information about the PaleoData (in this case sea surface temperature from alkenones) as well as Benthic data. Because the benthic data was used to establish th chronology, the data with its corresponding age is available through the ChronData object. Let's see how we can access series under this object."

However, frequency axes are notoriously hard to read, so the abscissa is expressed in terms of the period of oscillation, which is a lot easier to understand for us humans. Finally, notice that the code made use of the units in the LiPD file, and expressed the period in \"kyrs\".
