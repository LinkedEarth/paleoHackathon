    "\n",
    "For this hackathon, you will be using a Jupyter Lab environment. This notebook is designed to teach you how to use this environment, some basic Python terminology, and the data structures used by Pyleoclim. It assumes some familiarity with Python (scientific Python in particular). If a refresher is needed, we recommend these two notebooks from the [Introduction to Data Mining](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php) book:\n",
