    "To keep things simple and lower computational cost, let's focus on the last million years, and use the median age model. Now, a standard assumption of spectral analysis is that data are evenly spaced in time. In real-world paleo timeseries this is seldom the case. Let's look at the distribution of time increments in this particular core, as contrained by this tuned age model:"
