# FAQ

### Q: Who is this hackathon for?

A: This hackathon is open to any researcher engaged in paleoclimate research interested in adding the [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to their scientific toolkit. The computing environment will be a JupyterLab server, and all computations will be cloud-based, so no local installation of the packages and Python will be required, although a familiarity with the Scientific Python stack (i.e., pandas, numpy, matplotlib...) is expected. Attendance will be limited to 50 scholars, with priority given to US-based applicants, ECRs and people from groups traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences.

### Q: Do I need to know Python to attend this hackathon?

A: Familiarity with the [Scientific Python stack](https://barbagroup.github.io/essential_skills_RRC/jupyter/1/) is expected.

### Q: What are the technical requirements?

A: The computing environment will be a JupyterLab server, and all computations will be cloud-based, so no local installation of the packages and Python will be required. To attend, all you need is a computer, a stable internet connection, and access to Zoom and Slack.

### Q: How do I register for the workshop?

A: Please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/Kaj44ZVGsCwJLvvB6) by **February 7th, 2021**.

### Q: What will the schedule look like?

A: The hackathon will be held virtually, and take place over two days (Feb 18-19 2021) in the Pacific Standard Time zone (UTC-8) where the instructors are located. The morning lectures will be recorded via Zoom and made available through our Slack channel for delayed viewing. The schedule can be found [here](https://linkedearth.github.io/paleoHackathon/schedule). Schedule is subject to change. If you are participating in this Hackathon, make sure to connect through Slack to stay up-to-date.

### Q: What will be expected of me?

A: Two days of your time, your first newborn, $0.00, and a willingness to experiment with new tools (coping with the minor frustrations that such learning necessarily entails). On the last day, you will be expected to show what you managed to get through, and share what you and your team have learned in the process.  (we were joking about the first newborn).

### Q: What will I get out of this?

A: Data analytic superpowers of unmatched proportions in this corner of the galaxy, that's what! Seriously, code is only a facilitator of methods. At some point, if you want to use the tools in your research, you have to do the background reading to understand them. But we promise to make it easy for you to use and experiment with them, which helps developing an intuition for what they do.  You will also meet fellow researchers at various career stages, hence building your professional network.

### Q: What if I love Pyleoclim so much I can't stop using it?

A: that's a good problem to have. If you really love working with LiPD and Pyleoclim, we'll make it easy for you to keep using those tools after the workshop, either on your personal computer (a decent laptop should suffice) or (for a few people at a time) in the cloud.

### Q: OK, I'm sold. What happens next?

A: Please register [here](https://forms.gle/Kaj44ZVGsCwJLvvB6) by **February 7th, 2021**. Once you have, the organizers will review applications and email you back by Feb 13th. If you are selected, you will be asked to:
- do a little background reading
- log onto the JupyterHub platform
- run two introductory notebooks (in "Press play" mode)

This is to make sure you can hit the ground running on Feb 19.
