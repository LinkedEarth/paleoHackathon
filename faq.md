### Q: Who is this hackathon for?

A: This hackathon is open to any researcher engaged in paleoclimate research interested in applying the [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to their workflow. The computing environment will be a JupyterLab server, and all computations will be cloud-based, so no local installation of the packages and Python will be required, although a familiarity with the Scientific Python stack (i.e., pandas, numpy, matplotlib...) is expected. Attendance will be limited to 50 scholars, with priority given to US-based applicants, ECRs and people from groups traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences.
