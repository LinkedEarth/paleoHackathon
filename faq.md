# FAQ

### Q: Who is this hackathon for?

A: This hackathon is open to any researcher engaged in paleoclimate research interested in adding the [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to their scientific toolkit. The computing environment will be a JupyterLab server, and all computations will be cloud-based, so no local installation of the packages and Python will be required. Attendance will be limited to 50 scholars, with priority given to US-based applicants, ECRs and people from groups traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences.

### Q: What is the format?

A: This is a hackathon! In a hackathon, we hack, i.e. we re-use existing code to make it do our bidding. There will be short introductory lectures to get things started at the beginning of the day, but for the most part the learning is in **your** hands: you will learn at your own pace through [notebook](https://jupyter.org)-based practicums, working with teammates in similar timezones to get through a range of exercises, depending on your inclination and level.

### Q: Why are there so few lectures?

Our experience, and that of countless educators, is that coding is a hands-on skill. When you learned how to walk you did it through trial and error, and lots of practice ; coding is no different. You can take millions of hours of lectures and not know how to write a single line of code, so at some point you need to take a plunge. It sounds scary at first but we swear, the water is fine, and the beauty of Python is that you can get going in just a few minutes. You’ll be surprised how much you’ve learned by the event's end if you do these exercises!

### Q: Do I need to know Python to attend this hackathon?

A: You do not need to know any Python for this hackathon. Day 1 will be dedicated to help those with no prior experience to gain basic familiarity with the [Scientific Python stack](https://barbagroup.github.io/essential_skills_RRC/jupyter/1/).

### Q: What are the technical requirements?

A: The computing environment will be a JupyterLab server, and all computations will be cloud-based, so no local installation of the packages and Python will be required. To attend, all you need is a computer, a stable internet connection, and access to Zoom and Slack.

### Q: How do I register for the workshop?

A: Please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/MxfsVJhaa25YtiMe7) by **Feb 11th, 2022**.

### Q: What will the schedule look like?

A: The hackathon will be held virtually, and take place over three days (Mar 9-11) in the Pacific Standard Time zone (UTC-8) where the instructors are located. The first day is aimed at a basic Python introduction. If you already know Python, attendance on that day is optional. The morning lectures will be recorded via Zoom and made available through our Slack channel for delayed viewing. The schedule can be found [here](https://linkedearth.github.io/paleoHackathon/schedule). Schedule is subject to change. If you are participating in this Hackathon, make sure to connect through Slack to stay up-to-date.

### Q: What will be expected of me?

A: Two (or three) days of your time, your first newborn, $0.00, and a willingness to experiment with new tools (coping with the minor frustrations that climbing any learning curve necessarily entails). (we were joking about the first newborn). We do expect you to confirm your attendance, and be responsive to communications.

### Q: Will I be working alone?
A: You will be working in teams of 4-5, expertly crafted by the organizing committee to balance out knowledge and time zone. That is, we'll strive to put you with other folks on the same time zone as you are. If you are registering with a buddy and would like to be on the same team as them, please let us know!

### Q: What will I get out of this?

A: Data analytic superpowers of unmatched proportions in this corner of the galaxy, that's what! Seriously, code is only a facilitator of methods. At some point, if you want to use the tools in your research, you have to do the background reading to understand them. But we promise to make it easy for you to use and experiment with the methods, which helps developing an intuition for what they do.  You will also meet fellow researchers at various career stages, hence building your professional network.

### Q: Will PaleoHack make me a Python expert in 2-3 days?

A: That would be nice, but no. If you don't know *any* Python at the start, you will not learn it all here. The more knowledge you have going in, the more you should get out of the event. However, the event is designed for people of all levels to work and learn together about such topics as:
- Understand the basics of paleo data structures (LiPD, pyleo.Series, etc).
- Search and manipulate LiPD objects
- Understand age model ensembles
- Process paleo timeseries (binning, interpolation, detrending)
- Use the package to make publication-quality graphics

There are 3 practicums that cover these notions. You may or may not get through all of them on the first go, but you will learn something any which way! Once you are familiar with these, please re-apply to our intermediate hackathon, which will go into more details with methods.

### Q: Can I attend PaleoHack more than once?

A: Yes. Rome wasn't built in a day, and depending on your data science proficiency going in, it make take a couple of rounds to get everything out of PaleoHack. You may take the beginner hackathon as many times as you like, or attend our intermediate or advanced events.  

### Q: What if I love Pyleoclim so much I can't stop using it?

A: that's a good problem to have. If you really love working with LiPD and Pyleoclim, we'll make it easy for you to keep using those tools after the workshop, either on your personal computer (a decent laptop should suffice) or in the Cloud.

### Q: OK, I'm sold. What happens next?

A: Please register [here](https://forms.gle/MxfsVJhaa25YtiMe7) by **Feb 11th, 2022**.. Once you have, the organizers will review applications and email you back by Feb 15th. If you are selected, you will be asked to:
- do a little background reading
- be prepared to create/share a GitHub account with us
- share an email address for Slack

This is to make sure you can hit the ground running on March 9th.

### Q: My application was not accepted. What did I do wrong?
A: You did nothing wrong! There are many possible reasons, but in the past the lead causes of rejection have been:
- __rationale for attending is not sufficiently articulated__: You need to explain why it will advance your scientific career to do this. Vague responses to the questionnaires are often dismissed. Response such as "I want to learn Python" also often lead to a rejection. This is not a Python short course. You need to demonstrate how this training will apply to your research in paleoclimatology or related fields.
- __too many people from the same research group__. While we are honored that some PIs are encouraging their entire labs to apply, we strive to balance opportunities between universities/countries/continents. Therefore, we'll take a maximum of 2 people from the same research group per edition.
- __minimum requirements not met__: as written earlier, we think the training is pretty good, but it cannot perform miracles. A basic threshold of knowledge about paleoclimate data is an absolute minimum.

If you don't get in on the first try, you likely will on the next round. Persist!
